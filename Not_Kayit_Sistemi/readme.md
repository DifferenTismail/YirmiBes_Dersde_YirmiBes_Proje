# Student Grade Recording System

In this project, I developed a student grade recording system using Windows Forms. Students can view their own grades, grade averages, and statuses if they wish.

## Features

- **Student Page**: 
  - Students can view their grades.
  - Students can view their grade averages.
  - Students can view their statuses.

- **Teacher Page**: 
  - Teachers can enter grades for any student.
  - Teachers can update existing grades.
