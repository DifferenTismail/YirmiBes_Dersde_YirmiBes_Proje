# Voting Application

In this project, I developed a voting application using Windows Forms. Users can enter and submit their votes by selecting districts, and if they wish, they can view the total data in graphical form.

## Features

- **Voting Page**: 
  - Users can enter their votes.
  - Users can select districts to vote.
  - Users can view the total data in graphical form.
